# Plussing Review

Constructively improve any creative work by systematically asking "What would make this better?" - Walt Disney's methodology for continuous improvement through additive feedback rather than criticism.

---

## When to Use

- Reviewing any creative work, product, or project
- When asked for feedback or improvement suggestions
- When something feels "done" but could be better
- Team reviews where criticism tends to be destructive
- Iterating on designs, writing, products, or experiences
- When you hear "good enough" and want to push for great

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| subject | Yes | The work to be reviewed and improved |
| context | No | Goals, constraints, or intended audience |
| focus_areas | No | Specific aspects to concentrate plussing on |
| iteration | No | Is this first review or subsequent? |

---

## The Plussing Philosophy

"Whenever I go on a ride, I'm always thinking of what's wrong with the thing and how it can be improved." - Walt Disney

**Key distinction:** Plussing is not criticism. It's constructive addition.

| Criticism | Plussing |
|-----------|----------|
| "This doesn't work" | "What if we added..." |
| "I don't like this" | "This could be even better if..." |
| "This is wrong" | "Building on this, we could..." |
| "No" | "Yes, and..." |

Plussing never ends. Even after something launches, you keep improving it. Disneyland is never "done."

---

## The Plussing Framework

### Step 1: Appreciate What Exists

Before suggesting improvements, acknowledge what's working. This isn't politeness - it's identifying what to protect and build upon.

**Questions:**
- What's strong about this?
- What's the core that should be preserved?
- What would we lose if we started over?

### Step 2: Experience It Fresh

Put yourself in the audience/user perspective. Walk through the experience as if encountering it for the first time.

**Questions:**
- What do I feel at each moment?
- Where do I get excited? Confused? Bored?
- What story is this telling me?
- Where does magic happen? Where is it missing?

### Step 3: Identify Plus Opportunities

Look for specific moments where addition or enhancement would elevate the experience. Focus on:

**Detail pluses:** Small touches that add delight
**Emotional pluses:** Moments that could hit harder
**Coherence pluses:** Elements that could better support the whole
**Surprise pluses:** Unexpected delights to add
**Polish pluses:** Refinements that signal quality

### Step 4: Generate Plus Suggestions

For each opportunity, generate specific, actionable additions. Use "Yes, and..." framing.

**Format:** "What if we [specific addition] to [specific benefit]?"

### Step 5: Prioritize by Impact

Not all pluses are equal. Organize by:
- **Essential pluses:** Must-have improvements
- **Elevating pluses:** Significant enhancements
- **Delightful pluses:** Nice-to-have magic touches

## Plussing Categories

### Detail Plussing
Add small touches that signal quality and care.
- The texture of a button
- The sound when an action completes
- The transition between states
- The loading experience
- What happens at the edges

### Emotional Plussing
Intensify the feelings the experience creates.
- Heighten the peak moments
- Deepen the emotional payoffs
- Add anticipation before big reveals
- Create contrast (quiet before loud)
- Build to climaxes properly

### Story Plussing
Strengthen the narrative coherence.
- Does every element support the story?
- Are there gaps in the journey?
- Is the beginning compelling?
- Is the ending satisfying?
- Do transitions make sense?

### Surprise Plussing
Add unexpected delights.
- Hidden details for repeat visitors
- Easter eggs that reward attention
- Moments of delight in mundane places
- Subverted expectations (positive)
- Callbacks to earlier moments

### Polish Plussing
Refine craft and execution.
- Alignment and spacing
- Consistency of style
- Professional finishing touches
- Error states and edge cases
- Performance and responsiveness

---

## Constraints

- Never start with what's wrong - start with what's working
- Every criticism must become a plus suggestion
- Pluses should be specific and actionable, not vague
- Respect the creator's vision while elevating it
- Some things don't need plussing - recognize when done is done
- Plussing is iterative - not everything in one round

---

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Can't find anything working | Look harder - something got this far for a reason |
| Plus suggestions feel like criticism | Reframe: "What if..." instead of "This should..." |
| Too many pluses | Prioritize ruthlessly; do essential first |
| Creator defensive | Emphasize building on their work, not replacing it |
| Subject is fundamentally flawed | May need Dreamer-Realist-Critic instead of plussing |

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "Review this landing page for our productivity app. It has a hero section, feature list, pricing, and signup form."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Plussing Review: Productivity App Landing Page

### What's Working

1. **Clear value proposition** - "Get 2 hours back every day" immediately communicates benefit
2. **Social proof placement** - Customer logos above the fold builds credibility
3. **Feature organization** - Three-column layout is scannable
4. **Pricing transparency** - No hidden costs, clear comparison table

### Fresh Experience Walkthrough

| Moment | Feeling | Plus Opportunity |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| Hero section | Intrigued but generic | More specific, vivid benefit picture |
| Scrolling to features | Cognitive load | Progressive disclosure |
| Reading features | Informative but flat | Emotional connection to each |
| Pricing section | Clear but cold | Add human element, reduce anxiety |
| Signup form | Hesitation | Lower commitment first step |

### Plus Suggestions

#### Essential Pluses (High Impact)

1. **Hero specificity**
   - Current: "Get 2 hours back every day"
   - Plus: Add a specific scenario - "Imagine leaving work at 5pm with everything done"
   - Benefit: Moves from abstract promise to felt reality

2. **Social proof plus**
   - Current: Company logos
   - Plus: Add one rotating testimonial with face, name, specific result
   - Benefit: Logos show credibility; testimonials create connection

3. **Signup friction reduction**
   - Current: Full form (email, password, company)
   - Plus: "Try free for 14 days - just your email" with expanded form after
   - Benefit: Lower barrier to first commitment

#### Elevating Pluses (Medium Impact)

1. **Feature emotional hooks**
   - Plus: Each feature gets a one-line "This means..." connecting to feeling
   - Benefit: Features become benefits become emotions

2. **Pricing human touch**
   - Plus: "Questions? Chat with [Name]" with real photo near pricing
   - Benefit: Reduces purchase anxiety with human availability

3. **Progress visualization**
   - Plus: Subtle animation showing "before/after" of a cluttered vs. organized day
   - Benefit: Shows transformation, not just features

#### Delightful Pluses (Magic Touches)

1. **Scroll delight**
   - Plus: Subtle parallax on hero illustration as user scrolls
   - Benefit: Adds polish, signals quality

2. **Signup celebration**
   - Plus: Confetti micro-animation on successful signup
   - Benefit: Moment of delight at commitment point

3. **Loading state**
   - Plus: While page loads, show productivity tip instead of spinner
   - Benefit: Valuable even in wait state

### Plussed Vision

The landing page transforms from informative to immersive - visitors don't just learn about the product, they feel the relief of having their time back. Every element works harder: logos become testimonials, features become feelings, and the signup becomes an invitation rather than a form.

### Next Plus Cycle

After implementing essential pluses, review:
- Mobile experience (separate plus pass)
- Page speed (may need technical pluses)
- A/B test hero variations to validate specificity plus
